# üè• Healthcare Readmission Analysis 

This project explores U.S. hospital data to uncover insights about hospital distribution, types, and ownership across states. Using real-world datasets, the goal is to build a clean and visual exploratory analysis, setting the foundation for advanced analytics and cloud integration (AWS S3, Athena, QuickSight).

## Project Objectives
- Analyze hospital distribution by state
- Examine hospital ownership models
- Visualize hospital types and ratings
- Prepare data for cloud pipeline (AWS)

## Project Structure

- data/ : Dataset(s) from CMS
- notebooks/ : Jupyter Notebooks with data cleaning and analysis
- outputs/ : Visualizations and exported reports

## Visualizations
- Top states by number of hospitals
- Hospital types distribution
- Ownership analysis
- PDF report included

## Next Steps
- Upload dataset to AWS S3
- Use AWS Athena for query analysis
- Build QuickSight dashboard

## üß© Tools & Technologies
- Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub for version control
- AWS (planned): S3, Athena, QuickSight

## Visualizations

### Top 10 States by Number of Hospitals

### Hospital Type Distribution

## üìÑ Report
- [EDA Report PDF](outputs/EDA_Hospital_info.pdf)

## Next Steps
- Upload cleaned dataset to AWS S3
- Query with AWS Athena
- Build visual dashboard in AWS QuickSight
- Extend analysis with healthcare cost and patient outcome datasets

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Extension

This project has been extended to the cloud using AWS services for scalable analytics.

-  Uploaded cleaned hospital dataset to **Amazon S3**
-  Created external table in **AWS Athena** to query directly from S3
-  Ran queries in Athena to analyze hospital distribution across states
- Results exported for future visualization in **AWS QuickSight**

### Athena Query Example

```sql
SELECT state, COUNT(*) AS hospital_count
FROM healthcare_readmission
GROUP BY state
ORDER BY hospital_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
