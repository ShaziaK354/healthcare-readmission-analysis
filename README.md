# 🏥 Healthcare Readmission Analysis 📊

This project explores U.S. hospital data to uncover insights about hospital distribution, types, and ownership across states. Using real-world datasets, the goal is to build a clean and visual exploratory analysis, setting the foundation for advanced analytics and cloud integration (AWS S3, Athena, QuickSight).

## 🚀 Project Objectives
- Analyze hospital distribution by state
- Examine hospital ownership models
- Visualize hospital types and ratings
- Prepare data for cloud pipeline (AWS)

## 🗂️ Project Structure

- data/ : Dataset(s) from CMS
- notebooks/ : Jupyter Notebooks with data cleaning and analysis
- outputs/ : Visualizations and exported reports

## 📊 Visualizations
- Top states by number of hospitals
- Hospital types distribution
- Ownership analysis
- PDF report included

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Upload dataset to AWS S3
- Use AWS Athena for query analysis
- Build QuickSight dashboard

## 🧩 Tools & Technologies
- Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub for version control
- AWS (planned): S3, Athena, QuickSight

## 📊 Visualizations

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Upload cleaned dataset to AWS S3
- Query with AWS Athena
- Build visual dashboard in AWS QuickSight
- Extend analysis with healthcare cost and patient outcome datasets
